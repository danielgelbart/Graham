This is how my ruby/rails setup was done:
$) sudo apt-get update
$) sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core curl
$) bash < <( curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm )  #install rvm
-- Added line to ./bashrc file
$) sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxml2-dev autoconf    # packages recomended to help ruby (?)
$) rvm install 1.9.2 #Updated for 2014:
this command did not work anymore. Instead, I did:
  $   \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
  Then I was requested to run:
  $ source /home/daniel/.rvm/scripts/rvm

$) sudo apt-get  install libmysqlclient-dev mysql-client mysql-server

---------- Set up rails -----------
* Don't use 'sudo' with rvm


$ rvm use ruby 1.9.2  #set up ruby 1.9.2 on bash local
$ rvm gemset create rails238 # create a specific gem set
$ rvm ruby-1.9.2@rails238 # tell the gemset it is working with ruby 1.9.2
$ gem install rails -v 2.3.8 
--- Cloned my code from github - needed to generate ssh keys and update my public key on my github account ------
$ git clone git@github.com:danielgelbart/Graham.git
$ echo "rvm ruby-1.9.2@rails238" > .rvmrc # supposed to setup gemset for current folder
$ gem install bundler
--- added Gemfile
--- added config/preinitializer.rb following Yehuda katz's notes for rails 2.3
$ bundle install
--- still mising some packges, copy paste from rvm notes:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential bison openssl libreadline6 libreadline6-dev curl git-core zlib1g zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev autoconf libc6-dev ncurses-dev
# which installed only two new packages: libssl-dev libxlt1-dev
-- now removed ruby 1.9.2 and reinstalled hoping it will now hook into new packages
$ rvm remove 1.9.2
$ rvm install 1.9.2

# UPDATE 2014: the above lines worked, but I got a warning that ruby 1.9.2 no longer is maintained


-- hook up local host to point to application and install appache
in etc/hosts I added (needed to sudo emacs for this):
127.0.0.1 graham.local
$ gem install passenger
$ rvm update --head && rvm reload && rvm repair all
$ passenger-install-apache2-module
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev 
-- Added the following lines to etc/apache2/apach2.conf

   LoadModule passenger_module /home/dani/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails238/gems/passenger-3.0.7/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
   PassengerRoot /home/dani/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails238/gems/passenger-3.0.7
   PassengerRuby /home/dani/.rvm/wrappers/ruby-1.9.2-p180@rails238/ruby


 <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName graham.local
      DocumentRoot /home/dani/rails/Graham/public  
      RailsEnv development 
      <Directory home/dani/rails/Graham/public>
         AllowOverride all          
         Options -MultiViews        
      </Directory>
 </VirtualHost>

---------Set up sql-------------------
* create the 3 databasess in mysql: 'create database graham_dev'
// or with rake db:setup

--- Get rails 2.3.5 to work with bundler
To get rake tasks to work, must load the bundler environment, so do:
- bundle exec rake 'task'

- Added some code to config/boot.rg - following bundler tutorial for rails 2.3
- Added a config/preinitialize file - following same tutorial, but this does not work
- so added the same code (that requiers and expands bundler) to environment.rb

UPDATE 2014: Had to run:
$ gem update --system 1.8.25
To get rubygems to work (that is, so that I could use rake db:setup)
-------
To get rvm to work correctly from command line, I needed to set e 'Run command as login shell' checkbox on the Title and Command tab inside of gnome-terminal's Settings page

Then I set ruby 1.9.2 to the default
$  rvm --default use 1.9.2


-----------------------------------------------
Get emacs to work with ruby
emacs configuration is in ~/emacs.d 
So added lines to that file


----------------------------------------------
Highcharts.
There is a href injected into the bottom of the chart. this is done in the highcharts.js file. I did not remove it but instead replaced it with the text "--" to point to my name.
