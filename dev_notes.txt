eps

Can only get 10 years bakc using the rake command:
$ bundle exec rake eps:get_data[MSFT]



dividends can be gotten via the rake (and method from stock scraper)
$ bundle exec rake dividend:get_data[MSFT]
***However, as of Augost 2011, the website dividend.com no longer provids dividends for free, and these methods/commands do not work.
