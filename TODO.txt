0. Fiscal year end date
- I fixed it. Is it working???

1. stock list up to date?



2. Edgar ------------------------

   2.1 check acns on 10-k from 90's -V
   2.2 Move all rake tasks into edgar.rake and edgar.rb -V
   2.3 Extract finantial data from financial reports -V
***2.4 Older text files (2009) have XML data in XmlFileName.
       -> Parse these as xml!

1. fix get eps for stocks. The following stocks do NOT have eps records:
=> ["ABH", "AEI", "ACL", "AYE", "ALY", "ACRE", "ACF", "APO", "AHD", "AVO", "BEZ", "BVF", "BHS", "BF.A", "CBC", "CSFS", "CBF", "DCS", "CNB", "CTV", "CML", "CAL", "CYS", "DHRWI", "DLM", "DYP", "ECT", "FISWD", "FMR", "FRC", "FCEB", "FCEA", "GEOWI", "GLG", "GSL", "GTNA", "GAP", "GEFB", "HCA", "HEW", "HUBA", "HII", "IAR", "IMP", "VLT", "JCG", "JAS", "JWA", "KG", "KVA", "KVB", "LNY", "LEAWI", "LRP", "MX", "MSGY", "MFE", "MDRWI", "NNA", "NTY", "PLAA", "NAL", "PMG", "PLA", "Q", "RYI", "SEMG", "SVR", "TOD", "TRY", "UBP", "VRWD", "VZWI", "VOL", "JWB", "ZL"] 

OR fix price_limit method to not crash on missing eps data (return 0 instead?)

 Have yearly inflation instead of relative inflation. That is, have inflation per year and not from that year until now.
- Fixed. This was done up to and including 2011.

2. Dividends 
Update dividend scraping. and update for all stocks 2011. Dividinds site used for data is now a pay site. Need to hook up scraper to non-pay site.


3. Add nasdaq stocks. I had to manualy add MSFT and INTC

-------eps

Can only get 10 years bakc using the rake command:
$ bundle exec rake eps:get_data[MSFT]

dividends can be gotten via the rake (and method from stock scraper)
$ bundle exec rake dividend:get_data[MSFT]
***However, as of Augost 2011, the website dividend.com no longer provids dividends for free, and these methods/commands do not work.

1) Add search screens for: no earnings deficit, PE, dividend record, good ratios, etc
3) Add logging for failded searches, e.g. if could not get data for a stock


-------- SEC filing retrival ---------

1. Extract reports with SEC tags (instead of explicit string names)
2. Follow links for fiings (SCG fails for a single quarterly report on
this: 2014/Q2 )?

----SP500 data and Market PE Calculation----

Need to check that data is correct, and up to date
