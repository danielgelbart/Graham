TODO:

1. fix get eps for stocks. The following stocks do NOT have eps records:
=> ["ABH", "AEI", "ACL", "AYE", "ALY", "ACRE", "ACF", "APO", "AHD", "AVO", "BEZ", "BVF", "BHS", "BF.A", "CBC", "CSFS", "CBF", "DCS", "CNB", "CTV", "CML", "CAL", "CYS", "DHRWI", "DLM", "DYP", "ECT", "FISWD", "FMR", "FRC", "FCEB", "FCEA", "GEOWI", "GLG", "GSL", "GTNA", "GAP", "GEFB", "HCA", "HEW", "HUBA", "HII", "IAR", "IMP", "VLT", "JCG", "JAS", "JWA", "KG", "KVA", "KVB", "LNY", "LEAWI", "LRP", "MX", "MSGY", "MFE", "MDRWI", "NNA", "NTY", "PLAA", "NAL", "PMG", "PLA", "Q", "RYI", "SEMG", "SVR", "TOD", "TRY", "UBP", "VRWD", "VZWI", "VOL", "JWB", "ZL"] 

OR fix price_limit method to not crash on missing eps data (return 0 instead?)

 Have yearly inflation instead of relative inflation. That is, have inflation per year and not from that year until now.
- Fixed. This was done up to and including 2011.

2. Dividends 
Update dividend scraping. and update for all stocks 2011. Dividinds site used for data is now a pay site. Need to hook up scraper to non-pay site.


3. Add nasdaq stocks. I had to manualy add MSFT and INTC

-------eps

Can only get 10 years bakc using the rake command:
$ bundle exec rake eps:get_data[MSFT]

dividends can be gotten via the rake (and method from stock scraper)
$ bundle exec rake dividend:get_data[MSFT]
***However, as of Augost 2011, the website dividend.com no longer provids dividends for free, and these methods/commands do not work.



1) Add search screens for: no earnings deficit, PE, dividend record, good ratios, etc
2) Add a quarterly update for ongoing quarterly reports
3) Add logging for failded searches, e.g. if could not get data for a stock


-------- Quarterly

Added 'Quarter' column to ep and balance sheet.

1) Add scraping data for ALL 4 last quarter, save date/year for each.
2) Use in last year calculations
3) Display latest partial year data?
