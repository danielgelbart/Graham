Following Graham's marks for the 'conservative investor', the application scrapes all info about ~500 s&p companies. rake tasks will update the information from msn or yahoo if needed. Will scan for stable large consistant profitable companies and evaluate and supply info on:
No (or little) debt.
No earnings deficit in last 10 years.
Some consistant growth in earnings per share.
Consistant dividend pay out in last 30 years.
Assests more than double liabilities.
Trading at low multiple of earnings.

Will provide information on all above points. All data is inflation adjusted.


- Does not yet adjost for stock splits (in earnings per share)
- Sould be expanded for all NYSE stocks.
- update of information should be automated (provide a cron job for running rake tasks)

* Suplies financial data at the company level. Each company is linked to a common stock tiker - **Multiple securities trading for the same company are not accounted for (e.g MOG.A, MOG.B or BRK.A and BRK.B) instead a single security ticker is saved (ex. MOG.A, BRK.B).
- Such securities may trade a varying prices from each other and may be worth looking into and expanding application to link multiple tickers (securities) with the same company.
