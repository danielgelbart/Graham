Notes on Edgar:
Uses CIK to track companies (NOT ticker).
Has interactive data only for past few years. 

ABSOLUTELY NO COMMOM INTERFACE between companies. 

We want:
Total Revenue
Net Income
Current Assests
Total Assets
Current Liabilities
Total Liabilities

*IF net income and diluted number of share are available, we can
 calculate EPS on our own.
